# Pomodoro Timer Project 🍅

## Overview 

This Pomodoro Timer project is a web application that helps users manage their work and break intervals efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique.

The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly and customizable Pomodoro timer that allows users to set their work and break durations, start the timer. This timer will help users stay focused, increase productivity, and reduce burnout by encouraging regular breaks.

## Features

### 1. Timer Configuration ⏲️

- **Work Interval:** Users can set the duration of their work interval (e.g., 25 minutes) to suit their needs.
- **Break Interval:** Users can also customize the duration of their break interval (e.g., 5 minutes) to suit their preferences.

### 2. Start and Reset ⏯️

- **Start Timer:** Users can start the Pomodoro timer, which will run for the specified work interval duration.
- **Reset Timer:** Users can reset the timer to its initial state, clearing all progress.

### 4. Audio Alerts 🔉

- **Alerts:** Users will receive audio alerts (e.g., a chime) when a work or break phase ends, helping them stay on track without needing to watch the timer constantly.

## Technologies Used 🧑‍💻

- **HTML:** Used to structure the web page and create the user interface.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Used for implementing the timer logic, user interactions, and dynamic updates of the UI.
